                <h3>I have been a police officer for about 12 years. I spend the majority of my time as a patrol officer. I graduated from the PPB Detectives Academy and spent several months working with detectives in White Collar Crimes, helping with investigations. I recently graduated from The Tech Academy in Portland, where I learned to be a full stack web developer employing several programming/coding languages to create web pages and applications. I love being able to create programs with my new knowledge and have a strong desire to continue learning new things . I have an fantastic wife, two great kiddos and a awesome Jeep!</h3>
